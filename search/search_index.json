To get everything set up you should have a gcp project, if you have a gmail account and didn't use your trial, you can get free quota for 300$ which is sufficient for all testing we're doing in storage-bucket . Get the gcloud cli - quickstart Make a service account or find the default SA for storage bucket Change directory to this project directory and create a key with: gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account serviceaccount-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com replace serviceaccount-name and project-id with your own values. This will create the file key.json in your working dir. NOTE: If you decide to name file differently make sure you added its name into .gitignore , so it won't get pushed into the repo.

We follow wemake_python_styleguide to enforce quality. To run all tests: poetry run pytest To run linting: poetry run flake8 . To check typing: poetry run mypy . All of these steps will be executed in CI pipeline, so we recommend to install poetry run pre-commit install , so all checks will run before commiting.
