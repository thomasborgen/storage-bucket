# How to contribute

## Submitting your code

1. We use protected `main` branch, so the only way to push code is via [pull-request](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/pullrequest)
2. To implement new issue, you need to create either fix/name-of-the-bug or feature/name-of-the-feature
3. One of the commits should say Close #ISSUE_NUMBER, so pull-request will be associated with certain issue
4. Branch should be rebased on top of latest `main` branch
5. You can mark branch as `[WIP]` until it is finished and all checks are passed
6. When all the above steps succeeded mention one of the mainters and ask for the review
